## Example Playbook

This example is taken from `molecule/resources/converge.yml` and is tested on each push, pull request and release.
```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.dns
```

The machine may need to be prepared using `molecule/resources/prepare.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: Prepare
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  become: yes

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.bootstrap
    - role: robertdebock.core_dependencies
```

For verification `molecule/resources/verify.yml` run after the role has been applied.
```yaml
---
- name: Verify
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  vars:
    _nslookup_package:
      Alpine: bind-tools
      Archlinux: dnsutils
      Debian: dnsutils
      RedHat: bind-utils

    nslookup_package: "{{ _nslookup_package[ansible_os_family] }}"

  tasks:
    - name: install nslookup
      package:
        name: "{{ nslookup_package }}"
        state: present

    - name: test resolving www.example.com
      command: nslookup www.example.com 127.0.0.1
```

## Lookup module: cluster_dns

This module uses facter information to populate the nameserver information of dns_zones.

Example usage:
` dns_zones: "{{ lookup('cluster_dns', servers=groups['dns'], zones=my_zones, hostvars=hostvars, grouping='dns') }}"

- lookup: This calls the lookup module.
-- cluster_dns: The module being called.
-- servers: a list of servers being used for DNS.  The above example uses the inventory group DNS.
-- zones: dns_zone variable needing nameserver information.  
-- hostvars: hostvars.  This variable is created when the playbook is run.  It contains the needed IP information.
-- grouping: (Optional) places all of the dns ips behind a single name.  Useful if DNS server is also NTP, Consul...

## Requirements

- Access to a repository containing packages, likely on the internet.
- A recent version of Ansible. (Tests run on the current, previous and next release of Ansible.)

The following roles can be installed to ensure all requirements are met, using `ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml`:

```yaml
---
- robertdebock.bootstrap
- robertdebock.core_dependencies

```

## Context

This role is a part of many compatible roles. Have a look at [the documentation of these roles](https://robertdebock.nl/) for further information.

Here is an overview of related roles:
![dependencies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertdebock/drawings/artifacts/dns.png "Dependency")

## Compatibility

This role has been tested on these [container images](https://hub.docker.com/):

|container|tags|
|---------|----|
|amazon|all|
|alpine|all|
|debian|all|
|fedora|all|
|ubuntu|bionic|

The minimum version of Ansible required is 2.8 but tests have been done to:

- The previous version, on version lower.
- The current version.
- The development version.

## Exceptions

Some variarations of the build matrix do not work. These are the variations and reasons why the build won't work:

| variation                 | reason                 |
|---------------------------|------------------------|
| EL | RedHat does not supply `bind` without a subscription. |
| openSuse | Some tasks will not get idempotent. |


## Testing

[Unit tests](https://travis-ci.com/robertdebock/ansible-role-dns) are done on every commit, pull request, release and periodically.

If you find issues, please register them in [GitHub](https://github.com/robertdebock/ansible-role-dns/issues)

Testing is done using [Tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Molecule](https://github.com/ansible/molecule):

[Tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) tests multiple ansible versions.
[Molecule](https://github.com/ansible/molecule) tests multiple distributions.

To test using the defaults (any installed ansible version, namespace: `robertdebock`, image: `fedora`, tag: `latest`):

```
molecule test

# Or select a specific image:
image=ubuntu molecule test
# Or select a specific image and a specific tag:
image="debian" tag="stable" tox
```

Or you can test multiple versions of Ansible, and select images:
Tox allows multiple versions of Ansible to be tested. To run the default (namespace: `robertdebock`, image: `fedora`, tag: `latest`) tests:

```
tox

# To run CentOS (namespace: `robertdebock`, tag: `latest`)
image="centos" tox
# Or customize more:
image="debian" tag="stable" tox
```
